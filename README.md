# Temperature-Humidity-IoT
**Introduction**

The weather station collects the Temperature and Humidity data of the surroundings using DTH11 Sensor.

**Components Used:**

1\. Arduino Uno: The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc

2\. I2C Module

3\. 16x2 LCD

4\. DHT11 Module: DTH11 is very popular and very low-cost Digital Temperature and Humidity Sensor. It uses a Capacitive Humidity sensor, and a thermostat to measure the surrounding Air.

**Connection Procedure**

1\. Place the header pins onto the ports of the Arduino, and make sure that there’s contact and that the header pins are not loose.

2\. Carefully, using a glue gun, glue the header pins onto the Arduino, keeping sure that it doesn’t get loose while you’re doing it.

3\. Now solder the LCD display onto the header pins after aligning it on top of the LCD display.

LCD Connections:

LCD D7 –>DIGITAL PIN 2

LCD D6 –> 3

LCD D5 –> 4

LCD D4 –> 5

LCD E – > 11

LCD RS –> 12

LCD VDD –> (+) RAIL BREADBOARD

LCD VSS –> (-) RAIL BREADBOARD

LCD K –> (-) RAIL BREADBOARD

LCD RW –> (-) RAIL BREADBOARD

LCD VO –> Potentiometer Middle Pin

4\. Next, open Arduino IDE, Go to Sketch –> Include Library –> Add Zip File and then close the Arduino IDE and open it again. After doing this, you will find the library included.

Complete the circuit as given above and get the device working!
